To use this extension, go to an editable page on Wikipedia or another wiki (like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physical_constants). The pen icon should appear without a line through it. When clicked, the pen icon should take you to the edit link for the page you are viewing.

All non-editable pages (i.e. the Bing home page) should show the pen with the line through it and do nothing when clicked.
